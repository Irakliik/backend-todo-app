# Fullstack Todo App

This is a fullstack Todo application built with **Node.js, express.js MySQL, EJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The original front-end is based on a tutorial by [Coding2Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THEKW1gITJI&t=2115s).  
I added a **backend** with Node.js and MySQL, integrated EJS templating, and made minor CSS improvements.

## Features

### Backend (My Contributions)

- Persistent storage of todos with MySQL
- Add, update (toggle completion), and delete todos
- Input validation to prevent empty todos
- Async database operations with proper error handling
- Dynamic rendering with EJS

### Frontend (Based on Coding2Go)

- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Interactive UI with checkboxes and delete buttons
- Clean and simple design
